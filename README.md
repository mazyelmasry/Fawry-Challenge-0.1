This project is a basic bookstore inventory system created for Fawry’s Summer Internship. It supports two types of books:
  Paper books – can be shipped to the customer's address.
  EBooks – are sent to the customer's email.
  Books published before 2010 are removed from the inventory.

The project uses core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like:
  Abstraction – using a base Book class
  Inheritance – Paperbook and EBook extend Book
  Polymorphism – each book type has its own way of handling purchase
  Interfaces – used to define mailing and shipping behaviors
